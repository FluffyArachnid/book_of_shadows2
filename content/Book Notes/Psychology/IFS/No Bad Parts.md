## What are parts?
- The <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">mono-mind belief system</mark>—the idea that you have one mind, out of which different thoughts and emotions and impulses and urges emanate.
- IFS adheres to a different <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">paradigm of multiplicity</mark> that IFS espouses and considers the possibility that you and everybody else is a multiple personality.

- This isn't to suggest you have DID; although, <mark style="background: #E2B7FD9E;">what are called alters in those people are the same as what I call parts in IFS,</mark>
- The only difference is that people with Dissociative Identity Disorder <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">suffered horrible abuse and their system of parts got blown apart more than most</mark>, so each part stands out in bolder relief and is more polarized and disconnected from the others.
- All of us are born with many sub-minds that are constantly interacting inside of us. This is in general what we call <mark style="background: #A7D5C1A8;">thinking</mark>
- Because we just consider that to be a matter of having conflicted thoughts, <mark style="background: #A7D5C1A8;">we don’t pay attention to the inner players</mark> behind the debate.
- IFS helps you not only start to pay attention to them, but also become the active internal leader that your system of parts needs.
