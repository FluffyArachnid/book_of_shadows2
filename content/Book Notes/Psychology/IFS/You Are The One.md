> Unique aspects of our personalities (subpersonalities) that have their own thoughts, feelings, sensations, and agendas.

##### When love stops~
- When we get scared our partner might leave, <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">we tend to turn to three projects to salvage our connection</mark>:
	- The first two of these are designed to get our partner back into that loving redeemer role. The third project is to give up on that endeavor and find alternatives.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">The first, and most common</mark>, project involves directly trying to force our partner to change back.
	- ==The second project is to use many of those same crude tools on ourselves.== First we strive to figure out what our partner doesn’t like about us and then try to sculpt ourselves into what we think they want, even if that is a far cry from our true nature.
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">The final project kicks in once we give up on getting the love we crave from our partner</mark>.
	- All of these are <mark style="background: #A7BCD5A8;">exiling projects</mark>. In the first, we try to get our partner to exile the parts of them that threaten us. In the second, we work to exile the parts of us that we think they don’t like. In the third, we exile the parts of us that are attached to them.

##### Becoming the caretaker of our own parts~
- The first step toward that goal is to <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">shift your focus.</mark>
- We try to get couples to do a complete U-turn in their focus,  <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">moving them toward</mark>, rather than away from, the inner worlds in which they fear to tread.
> - Walt Whitman: 
> - “Song of Myself”: “Do I contradict myself? Very well then I contradict myself. (I am large, I contain multitudes).”
- In a powerful state  of internal focus, they could dialogue with their parts about what motivated them to react in such irrational or self-defeating ways.

> [!Self]
> - As people learn to separate from their parts, they tap into a calm, centered energy called "Self".

- In accessing this state of Self, clients are tapping into something deeper and more foundational than all these conflicting inner warriors—<mark style="background: #A7D5D5B3;">something that spiritual traditions often call “soul” or “essence.</mark>
	- Another piece of this is what therapist's call "<mark style="background: #A7D5C1A8;">Mindfulness</mark>"

> [!Self-Leadership] 
> In Self, clients realize that they already know how to take care of their inner exiles on their own and that those parts don’t need salvation because they were never bad to begin with.

- When couples can both reach Self,  a dramatic shift occurred in their interactions with each other about problems in their relationship.
	- Even when discussing emotion-laden content, partners could hold a respectful and compassionate tone and were able to listen without defending themselves.
	- <mark style="background: #E2B7FD9E;">Because they remained a little separated from their parts</mark>, they could speak for those powerful feelings rather than being flooded by them and speaking from them.
	- Two main things to gain from this:
		- The first is that you—your Self—will <mark style="background: #FDB7B7A8;">become the primary caretaker of your exiles so that your partner can be their secondary caretaker</mark>. When that is the case, your protectors can abandon all their projects, and you can enjoy your partner for who they are, not what you want them to be. Ironically, in turn, your partner will be better able to drop their guard enough to become vulnerable and reciprocate the love that you seek.
		- Secondly,  <mark style="background: #A7D5D5B3;">you will be able to interact with your partner from your Self</mark>, which not only will resolve, or make far less potent, the long-standing issues between you but also foster the sense of intimacy and deep connectedness that is sustaining to both of you.
> -Margaret Mead
> -"The American marriage . . . is one of the most difficult marriage forms that the human race has ever attempted.”

##### Isolation~
- Not only is the couple isolated from its community but <mark style="background: #A7BCD5A8;">each partner is often cut off from the other by the outrageous requirements of work or by the excessive demands of raising children</mark> far from the help of kin networks.
	- Finally, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">partners are cut off from their Selves by being raised in a society that is so concerned with external appearances that authentic inner desires are ignored</mark> and feared.
	- In this society, we leave our parents and our children leave us; <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">the only person who is supposed to be with us forever is our partner.</mark>
	- However, if we had been taught how to heal our own parts, I believe we would be able to meet many of our needs in an intimate relationship because <mark style="background: #A7BCD5A8;">we wouldn’t be as needy.</mark>
	- ==When your partner is freed from the extreme pressures to both caretake your parts and deal with your rage or pouting when they don’t, your partner can be the lover, companion, and co-adventurer that you want.==
- Without a constant stream of affirmation from an intimate partner, most of us will experience these feelings to some degree: <mark style="background: #E2B7FD9E;">worthless, empty, like a loser, lonely, rejected, desperate, ugly, boring, insecure, and afraid</mark>
	- What we call happiness is often relief about not being in those states.
	- This kind of head-above-water happiness is unstable and easily disturbed. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Our partner will buckle under the strain of holding us up</mark>, and big waves (such as failures at work or criticism from parents) will wash over us no matter how hard our partner works to save us
> -Leonord Cohen
>-“You are locked into your suffering, and your pleasures are the seal.”

##### The Empty Self~
- ==The Empty self== “that experiences a significant absence of community, tradition, and shared meaning . . . a self that embodies the absences, loneliness, and disappointments of life as a chronic, undifferentiated emotional hunger.”
- <mark style="background: #A7D5D5B3;">Stress, depletion, and isolation make it harder to control our inner demons</mark>, consequently increasing the pressure on our one intimate relationship to keep the waves of self-loathing and insecurity at bay.

##### Gender Socialization~
<mark style="background: #E2B7FD9E;">Men</mark>
- A traditional, patriarchal form of child-rearing, dominant in our culture for many decades, was clear in its effects on the inner lives of boys and girls. In that pattern, boys were nurtured by their caretaker (usually their mother) until a certain young age—perhaps four or five—when, out of fear of their being sissified, <mark style="background: #A7BCD5A8;">they were wrenched away and often brutally shamed by their father or by peers for expressions of weakness or any emotions other than aggressiveness and anger</mark>—anything considered feminine.

> [!alexithymia] 
> Being so cut off from those emotions that they don’t have words to describe them.

- To keep their dark fear and loneliness at bay, <mark style="background: #A7D5C1A8;">men become dominated by rational, aggressive, competitive, never-let-’em-see-you-sweat protectors</mark> that can serve them well in professional contexts and are determined to never again allow them to be hurt or humiliated.
- Men are also taught to bolster their fragile self-esteem by objectifying and pursuing trophy women.
- Now men are still expected to be strong and high-achieving in the outside world, but within their relationship they should be emotionally intelligent—in touch with and open about their feelings and nurturing of their partner’s feelings.
- Suddenly they are supposed to access the very same vulnerable, sensitive, and caring parts that they spent their lives trying to keep locked up.
- Since in their relationships they can’t rely on aggressiveness or rationality anymore, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">many men just give up and hide behind stony walls of indifference and passivity,</mark> which only further enrages their partners.
<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Women</mark>
- The parts of girls, however, that were <mark style="background: #E2B7FD9E;">bright and assertive, lively and competent</mark>, were exiled, and <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">girls became dominated by self-critical protectors</mark> that kept them obsessed with the needs of others and with appearing attractive to men.
- Because of being raised in families where men were more highly valued, these <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">girls also had exiles that felt worthless and focused on the approval of a father</mark> who was increasingly threatened by them and who distanced from them as they developed physically.
- Women, on the other hand, faced their own quandaries as gender expectations shifted. In the post-1960s world, they were expected to shed their subservient and self-sacrificing selves and find their power—the assertive and ambitious parts they had exiled earlier.
- Consciously or not, their caretaker parts still had a powerful influence, which led them to do more than their share at home (in full collusion with their husbands’ entitled parts) while also working outside the home.
- The inner battles between women’s caretakers and their assertive parts often built over time until, seemingly out of the blue, their assertive protectors would explode with an intensity that left their husbands stunned.

<mark style="background: #A7BCD5A8;">John Gottman's work</mark>:
	- Gottman found men and women are very different in how they handle conflict. For example, in terms of blood pressure and heart-rate changes, men react much more strongly than women when they begin to get into marital conflict, and they stay activated much longer.
	- <mark style="background: #A7D5D5B3;">Men are also more likely to keep angry, vengeful thoughts running</mark> through their heads even after the fight is over.

> [!"Stonewallers"] 
> People who turn away from and completely ignore their partners in the face of criticism.

- men were the stonewallers 85 percent of the time during conflict in the relationship.
	- <mark style="background: #FDB7B7A8;">Women are more likely to bring up issues</mark> that lead to arguments and to be critical of their husbands.
	- Given that men have highly vulnerable exiles that they try to keep locked up at all costs, it makes sense that <mark style="background: #A7D5C1A8;">criticism from their wives would trigger the shame those exiles carry,</mark> which would account for men’s extreme physiological reactions.
	- They are loathe to expose and don’t have words to describe the intense vulnerability they feel, and their customary protectors are taboo. Shutting down externally seems like the safest choice while, as Gottman found, <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">internally their stifled angry protectors continue to roil beneath the surface and keep them stirred up.</mark>
	- Far more than men, <mark style="background: #E2B7FD9E;">women are socialized to take care of their exiles through relationships</mark>. Therefore, when their exiles are upset, women want to change things in their marriages so that their distressed exiles get from their husbands the love and comfort those parts need to feel secure.
	- In addition, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">because of the collusion between women’s caretaker parts and men’s entitled ones, real imbalances often exist in the lifestyles of each spouse</mark>—the wife has more responsibility and fewer resources—that fuel her rage and his reluctance to talk.
	- Because women want a relational solution to their pain, their inner critics take aim at their husband and, when that doesn’t work, at themselves, in an effort to open his heart.
	- Men, <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">partly in response to what feels like intolerable criticism</mark>, will give up sooner on the intimacy-generating projects and will focus instead on distractions that make them feel good, such as work, sports, and drinking alcohol.
	- The exiles knew that this trickle of affection was all that kept them from a return to utter love-starvation and worthlessness. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">This phenomenon also explains why some men who seem so detached from their spouses are simultaneously so possessive and jealous, to the point of stalking and threatening them when they try to leave.</mark>
	- "I’ll end this section on gender differences by reiterating a couple of points. The first challenges a prevalent belief in our culture and among couples therapists—the assumption that because women are closer to their feelings and are more relational than men, they are better equipped for intimacy. In contrast, I believe that <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">because women’s focus is so much on caretaking others and on getting their exiles cared for by a relationship, they are no better at nurturing their own parts than are men.</mark>"
	- "The second point is that these gender patterns are not exclusively due to biological differences in vulnerability or emotionality. <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">While biological differences exist and should not be minimized, both genders have been socialized to create exiles."</mark>
