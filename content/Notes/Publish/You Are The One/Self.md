[[You Are The One]]

- As clients learn to <mark style="background: fc94af;">separate from their extreme emotions and thoughts</mark> (their parts) in this way, I find that they spontaneously tap into a calm, centered state, which I call their [[Notes/Book Notes/Psychology/IFS/IFS Terms|Self]].

- We try to get couples to do a complete U-turn in their focus,  <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">moving them toward</mark>, rather than away from, the inner worlds in which they fear to tread.

- When accessing this state of  [[Notes/Book Notes/Psychology/IFS/IFS Terms|Self]], clients are tapping into something deeper and more foundational than all these conflicting inner warriors—<mark style="background: #A7D5D5B3;">something that spiritual traditions often call “soul” or “essence.</mark>
	- Another piece of this is what therapist's call "<mark style="background: #A7D5C1A8;">Mindfulness</mark>"
	
- In a powerful state  of internal focus, they could dialogue with their parts about what motivated them to react in such irrational or self-defeating ways.
