[[You Are The One]]
#### Exile Projects

---

The first two of these are designed to get our partner back into that loving redeemer role. The third project is to give up on that endeavor and find alternatives.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">The first, and most common,</mark>project involves directly trying to force our partner to change back.
	- ==The second project is to use many of those same crude tools on ourselves.== First we strive to figure out what our partner doesn’t like about us and then try to sculpt ourselves into what we think they want, even if that is a far cry from our true nature.
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">The final project kicks in once we give up on getting the love we crave from our partner</mark>.
	- All of these are <mark style="background: #A7BCD5A8;">[[You Are The One|Exiling Projects]]</mark>. In the first, we try to get our partner to exile the parts of them that threaten us. In the second, we work to exile the parts of us that we think they don’t like. In the third, we exile the parts of us that are attached to them.<mark style="background: #A7D5C1A8;"></mark>
