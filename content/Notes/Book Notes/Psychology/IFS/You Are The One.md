##### When love stops
---

- When we get scared our partner might leave, <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">we tend to turn to three projects to salvage our connection</mark>:
	- [[Exiling Projects]]

##### Becoming the caretaker of our own parts~
---

- The first step toward that goal is to <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">[[Notes/Book Notes/Psychology/IFS/Self|shift your focus]]</mark>

##### Communicating through Self
---

- When couples can both reach Self,  a dramatic shift occurred in their interactions with each other about problems in their relationship.
	- Even when discussing emotion-laden content, partners could hold a respectful and compassionate tone and were able to listen without defending themselves.
	- <mark style="background: #E2B7FD9E;">Because they remained a little separated from their parts</mark>, they could <mark style="background: #A7D5C1A8;"></mark>speak for those powerful feelings rather than being flooded by them and speaking from them.
	- Two main things to gain from this:
		- The first is that you—your Self—will <mark style="background: #FDB7B7A8;">become the primary caretaker of your exiles so that your partner can be their secondary caretaker</mark>. When that is the case, your protectors can abandon all their projects, and you can enjoy your partner for who they are, not what you want them to be. Ironically, in turn, your partner will be better able to drop their guard enough to become vulnerable and reciprocate the love that you seek.
		- Secondly,  <mark style="background: #A7D5D5B3;">you will be able to interact with your partner from your Self</mark>, which not only will resolve, or make far less potent, the long-standing issues between you but also foster the sense of intimacy and deep connectedness that is sustaining to both of you.
##### Isolation~
- Not only is the couple isolated from its community but <mark style="background: #A7BCD5A8;">each partner is often cut off from the other by the outrageous requirements of work or by the excessive demands of raising children</mark> far from the help of kin networks.
	- Finally, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">partners are cut off from their Selves by being raised in a society that is so concerned with external appearances that authentic inner desires are ignored</mark> and feared.
	- In this society, we leave our parents and our children leave us; <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">the only person who is supposed to be with us forever is our partner.</mark>
	- However, if we had been taught how to heal our own parts, I believe we would be able to meet many of our needs in an intimate relationship because <mark style="background: #A7BCD5A8;">we wouldn’t be as needy.</mark>
	- ==When your partner is freed from the extreme pressures to both caretake your parts and deal with your rage or pouting when they don’t, your partner can be the lover, companion, and co-adventurer that you want.==
- Without a constant stream of affirmation from an intimate partner, most of us will experience these feelings to some degree: <mark style="background: #E2B7FD9E;">worthless, empty, like a loser, lonely, rejected, desperate, ugly, boring, insecure, and afraid</mark>
	- What we call happiness is often relief about not being in those states.
	- This kind of head-above-water happiness is unstable and easily disturbed. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Our partner will buckle under the strain of holding us up</mark>, and big waves (such as failures at work or criticism from parents) will wash over us no matter how hard our partner works to save us

##### The Empty Self~
- ==The Empty self== “that experiences a significant absence of community, tradition, and shared meaning . . . a self that embodies the absences, loneliness, and disappointments of life as a chronic, undifferentiated emotional hunger.”
- <mark style="background: #A7D5D5B3;">Stress, depletion, and isolation make it harder to control our inner demons</mark>, consequently increasing the pressure on our one intimate relationship to keep the waves of self-loathing and insecurity at bay.

##### Gender Socialization~
<mark style="background: #E2B7FD9E;">Men</mark>
- A traditional, patriarchal form of child-rearing, dominant in our culture for many decades, was clear in its effects on the inner lives of boys and girls. In that pattern, boys were nurtured by their caretaker (usually their mother) until a certain young age—perhaps four or five—when, out of fear of their being sissified, <mark style="background: #A7BCD5A8;">they were wrenched away and often brutally shamed by their father or by peers for expressions of weakness or any emotions other than aggressiveness and anger</mark>—anything considered feminine.



- To keep their dark fear and loneliness at bay, <mark style="background: #A7D5C1A8;">men become dominated by rational, aggressive, competitive, never-let-’em-see-you-sweat protectors</mark> that can serve them well in professional contexts and are determined to never again allow them to be hurt or humiliated.
- Men are also taught to bolster their fragile self-esteem by objectifying and pursuing trophy women.
- Now men are still expected to be strong and high-achieving in the outside world, but within their relationship they should be emotionally intelligent—in touch with and open about their feelings and nurturing of their partner’s feelings.
- Suddenly they are supposed to access the very same vulnerable, sensitive, and caring parts that they spent their lives trying to keep locked up.
- Since in their relationships they can’t rely on aggressiveness or rationality anymore, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">many men just give up and hide behind stony walls of indifference and passivity,</mark> which only further enrages their partners.
<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Women</mark>
- The parts of girls, however, that were <mark style="background: #E2B7FD9E;">bright and assertive, lively and competent</mark>, were exiled, and <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">girls became dominated by self-critical protectors</mark> that kept them obsessed with the needs of others and with appearing attractive to men.
- Because of being raised in families where men were more highly valued, these <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">girls also had exiles that felt worthless and focused on the approval of a father</mark> who was increasingly threatened by them and who distanced from them as they developed physically.
- Women, on the other hand, faced their own quandaries as gender expectations shifted. In the post-1960s world, they were expected to shed their subservient and self-sacrificing selves and find their power—the assertive and ambitious parts they had exiled earlier.
- Consciously or not, their caretaker parts still had a powerful influence, which led them to do more than their share at home (in full collusion with their husbands’ entitled parts) while also working outside the home.
- The inner battles between women’s caretakers and their assertive parts often built over time until, seemingly out of the blue, their assertive protectors would explode with an intensity that left their husbands stunned.

<mark style="background: #A7BCD5A8;">John Gottman's work</mark>:
	- Gottman found men and women are very different in how they handle conflict. For example, in terms of blood pressure and heart-rate changes, men react much more strongly than women when they begin to get into marital conflict, and they stay activated much longer.
	- <mark style="background: #A7D5D5B3;">Men are also more likely to keep angry, vengeful thoughts running</mark> through their heads even after the fight is over.



- men were the stonewallers 85 percent of the time during conflict in the relationship.
	- <mark style="background: #FDB7B7A8;">Women are more likely to bring up issues</mark> that lead to arguments and to be critical of their husbands.
	- Given that men have highly vulnerable exiles that they try to keep locked up at all costs, it makes sense that <mark style="background: #A7D5C1A8;">criticism from their wives would trigger the shame those exiles carry,</mark> which would account for men’s extreme physiological reactions.
	- They are loathe to expose and don’t have words to describe the intense vulnerability they feel, and their customary protectors are taboo. Shutting down externally seems like the safest choice while, as Gottman found, <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">internally their stifled angry protectors continue to roil beneath the surface and keep them stirred up.</mark>
	- Far more than men, <mark style="background: #E2B7FD9E;">women are socialized to take care of their exiles through relationships</mark>. Therefore, when their exiles are upset, women want to change things in their marriages so that their distressed exiles get from their husbands the love and comfort those parts need to feel secure.
	- In addition, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">because of the collusion between women’s caretaker parts and men’s entitled ones, real imbalances often exist in the lifestyles of each spouse</mark>—the wife has more responsibility and fewer resources—that fuel her rage and his reluctance to talk.
	- Because women want a relational solution to their pain, their inner critics take aim at their husband and, when that doesn’t work, at themselves, in an effort to open his heart.
	- Men, <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">partly in response to what feels like intolerable criticism</mark>, will give up sooner on the intimacy-generating projects and will focus instead on distractions that make them feel good, such as work, sports, and drinking alcohol.
	- The exiles knew that this trickle of affection was all that kept them from a return to utter love-starvation and worthlessness. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">This phenomenon also explains why some men who seem so detached from their spouses are simultaneously so possessive and jealous, to the point of stalking and threatening them when they try to leave.</mark>
	- "I’ll end this section on gender differences by reiterating a couple of points. The first challenges a prevalent belief in our culture and among couples therapists—the assumption that because women are closer to their feelings and are more relational than men, they are better equipped for intimacy. In contrast, I believe that <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">because women’s focus is so much on caretaking others and on getting their exiles cared for by a relationship, they are no better at nurturing their own parts than are men.</mark>"
	- "The second point is that these gender patterns are not exclusively due to biological differences in vulnerability or emotionality. <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">While biological differences exist and should not be minimized, both genders have been socialized to create exiles."</mark>
##### Multiplicity vs Monalythic
- It is much easier not to write off your partner when you know you have an <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">inner family with lots of different perspectives and desires</mark> than when you take as gospel all the intense feelings about your partner that come up inside you during the dance of intimacy.

- If, on the other hand, <mark style="background: #A7BCD5A8;">you recognize that your sudden absence of love is caused by the activation of protective parts of you</mark> that have blocked your love in the way that the moon obscures the sun during an eclipse, you can trust that there is no need to panic or do something rash. 

- Rather than loathing yourself and trying to suppress those thoughts, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">you can treat yourself with the kind of amused patience and understanding</mark> that a parent might bring to their angry two-year-old.

- The ability to hold the multiplicity perspective about yourself and your partner is enhanced by the simple (but often difficult) act of speaking for, rather than from, your parts. <mark style="background: #FDB7B7A8;">If, when you get angry, you say, “A part of me hates you right now,” your partner gets an entirely different message than if you say, “I hate you right now.”</mark> This is not just because the former words remind your partner that it is just a part, not all of you.


- Knowledge of our multiplicity also helps when your partner says hurtful things or acts in extreme ways.

- If you both understand that <mark style="background: #E2B7FD9E;">those are just small parts of you—parts that carry burdens of worthlessness, insecurity, distorted sexual impulses, and so on</mark>; parts that simply need empathy and acceptance to heal—it’s easier for you to reveal them and for your partner to respond lovingly.

- When this process of vulnerability and acceptance is mutual, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">couples form such a secure connection that their protectors relax,</mark> and their young parts know it’s safe to pop out at any time.

##### Well Fed Parts

- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">The basement of your psyche is filled with love-starved, vulnerable inner children.</mark>

- Because they get so little from you, <mark style="background: #A7D5D5B3;">they will be obsessed with finding someone they imagine can rescue them</mark> and, out of their desperation, will blind you to that person’s faults.

- Where can you find a boundless fountain of love from which your parts can draw? <mark style="background: #A7D5C1A8;">It’s in the last place you would ever think to look: your Self</mark>

- You will find that, just as is true of well-fed children in the outside world, your inner characters will transform—they’ll become lighter and happier—when you feed rather than starve them. When that’s the case, <mark style="background: #FDB7B7A8;">they will enhance rather than encumber your intimate relationships</mark>.. Your partner will appreciate this arrangement because they won’t feel the weight of your emotional dependence or the sting of your rage when they are unintentionally neglectful.

- With this arrangement, your parts can stay calm and not panic when your partner distances, not fear being hurt when they get close, <mark style="background: #E2B7FD9E;">and allow your partner to be who they are rather than make them into the image of the person they have been dreaming of.</mark>

- Intimacy is often defined as the ability to reveal all aspects of oneself to another and feel accepted. Because you aren’t ashamed or afraid of your vulnerable parts, you can expose them to your partner and experience the joy of being fully known and witnessed by another.

- Consequently, you communicate your hurt with clarity and respect, without the blaming or pouting that commonly typifies such interactions. In turn, your partner is able to act in a compassionate manner, which helps your parts revise their beliefs about intimate relationships and unload the pain they carry from the past.

##### How Exiles Develop

- Everyone is born with vulnerable parts. Most of us, however, learn early—through interactions with caretakers or through traumatic experiences—that being vulnerable is not safe

- As a consequence, we lock those childlike parts away inside and make them the inner exiles of our personalities.

- On the other hand, some people are lucky enough to have caretakers who react to their vulnerability with love, patience, tenderness, and nurturance. If that was true for you, you don’t have as many exiles. Because your caretakers accepted and embraced you when those sensitive parts of you were present, you learned to relate to those parts in the same way—with acceptance and love.

- When, as children, our parts were upset and consequently became extreme in one way or another—selfish, shy, agitated, tantrumming, demanding, hitting, acting out sexually, fearful, and so on—we triggered parts of our parents because they had no patience for those same parts in themselves.

- Consequently, when you were hurt, needy, pouty, demanding, tantrumming, or crying, it would trigger your caregiver to react in an extreme way rather than with the warm nurturance or calm limit-setting that your parts needed.

- Our exiles are often our most sensitive parts because they are the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">ones most hurt by the rejections, humiliations, traumas, and abandonments of our harsh environment</mark> and, while in their state of hurt or need, the parts that most trigger the people around us.

There are <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">three primary reasons</mark> you wound up exiling your most precious aspects.
	- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Your Vulnerability, in Its Natural, Innocent State, Bothered Your Caretakers or Peers</mark>
	- This happened if your caregivers were:
		- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">depressed or in conflict with each other</mark> such that there was no room for your neediness and, instead, you had to worry about and care for them;
		- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">neglectfully preoccupied</mark> such that you had to raise yourself and/or your siblings;
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">using you as a surrogate spouse</mark> or living vicariously through your achievements;
		- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">convinced that you had to be tough to survive</mark> or highly competitive to succeed; or
		- <mark style="background: #A7BCD5A8;">afraid or disdainful of their own needines</mark>s and, consequently, were verbally or physically abusive.
<mark style="background: #A7D5C1A8;"></mark>
